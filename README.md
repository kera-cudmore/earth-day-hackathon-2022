# Charity Earth

Charity Earth was created as part of the April 2022 Earth Day Hackathon held by the Code Institute.

Charity Earth - Tell us what you value - The fun way to discover new environmental charities! Take a short quiz and based on your areas of interest we will suggest a charity that would love a donation from you.

Don't have any spare funds but still want to contribute? Select to donate your time instead! Want to donate to a specific area of the UK? We can help you find the right charity for that area.

## User Experience

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* To quickly and easily discover charities that are local to me, that have an environmental focus, and which reflect my values and interests, without having to research and compare a range of organisations.

* To be profiled for these recommendations through a light-hearted, multiple choice quiz.

* To be presented with a link to my recommended organisationâ€™s website.

* To feel secure in the knowledge that my recommended organisation is a legitimate,  registered charity.

* To  be able to easily navigate back to the homepage after completing the quiz if I wish to repeat the quiz with different answers.

* To have a means of learning more about Earth Day, and its theme for 2022, as well as a resource for discovering more organisations that work in these areas.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

* To be able to access a full list of the charities for my area of choice, without having to navigate the quiz repeatedly to get different results.

* To have different quiz questions presented to me based on my earlier choices in the quiz, creating a sense a variety that encourages repeat use.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

We wanted to choose colours that reflected the environment, so we have chosen a variety of greens, blues and browns for our site.

![Colour Palette](readme/colour-palette.png)

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

We have chosen to use the oxygen font. This is a sans serif font which is great for accessibility and dyslexic users. We also felt the name was very fitting for use on our site for Earth Day ðŸ˜Š.

### Imagery

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using Balsamiq.

### Features

The website is comprised of 2 pages, the index page and the 404 page.

The index page is divided into sections, the hero image, the quiz, the information section and the contact section.

The 404 page lets the user know that there has been an error and gives them the option through a choice of buttons to be redirected to the home page, the quiz section, the information section and the contact us section.

* All Pages on the website have:

  * A favicon. We have chosen to use an image of the Earth to tie our site in the with Earth Day theme of the hackathon.

    ![Favicon](readme/favicon.png)

  * A footer. The footer contains links to the various sections of the site for ease of naviagation.

    ![Footer image](readme/footer.png)

* Future Implementations.

### Accessibility

We have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
