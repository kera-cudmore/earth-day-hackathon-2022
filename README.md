## User Experience

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* To quickly and easily discover charities that are local to me, that have an environmental focus, and which reflect my values and interests, without having to research and compare a range of organisations.

* To be profiled for these recommendations through a light-hearted, multiple choice quiz.

* To be presented with a link to my recommended organisationâ€™s website.

* To feel secure in the knowledge that my recommended organisation is a legitimate,  registered charity.

* To  be able to easily navigate back to the homepage after completing the quiz if I wish to repeat the quiz with different answers.

* To have a means of learning more about Earth Day, and its theme for 2022, as well as a resource for discovering more organisations that work in these areas.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

* To be able to access a full list of the charities for my area of choice, without having to navigate the quiz repeatedly to get different results.

* To have different quiz questions presented to me based on my earlier choices in the quiz, creating a sense a variety that encourages repeat use.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Colour Palette](readme/colour-palette.png)

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

We have chosen to use the oxygen font. This is a sans serif font which is great for accessibility and dyslexic users. We also felt the name was very fitting for use on our site for Earth Day ðŸ˜Š.

* Future Implementations.

### Accessibility

We have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
